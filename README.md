## Challenges & Lessons Learned

### Routing in Next.js
As someone new to the Next.js App Router, getting used to the new file structure took some time, but it has been a smooth experience so far.

### Error Handling
With Next.js, it is easier to define error boundaries and handle unexpected failures.

### `'use client'` vs. `'use server'`
I initially struggled with this concept, but I learned that any component requiring event listeners should use `'use client'`.

## Future Improvements

- Implement caching for faster searches  
- Add suggestions for misspelled words  
- Improve UI/UX with better animations
